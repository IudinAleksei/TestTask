# TestTask

1. Implement a function with two arguments, both are lists of possibly different length. The function must return dictionary (dict for Python or object for JS) with keys from the first list and corresponding values from the second. If a key lacks value, resulting dictionary must contain None for that key (or null for JavaScript). Redundant values must be ignored. Keys are guaranteed to be unique.

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... . By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Implementation:

1. Function createDictionary has two arguments (empty array by default), type of the arguments is checked before execution.
All keys with corresponding values is add to empty object without prototype as properties.

2. Function fibonacciEvenValuesSum hasn't arguments. The limit for the values is set by the constatnt LIMIT. Before execution LIMIT is checked to be greater 1 and be safeInteger.
